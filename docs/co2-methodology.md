# CO₂-per-Storage Calculator — Methodology & Source of Truth

**Purpose:** This file defines the constants, formula, and defensible ranges used by the
storage-CO₂ calculator. It is the single source of truth. The numeric values are mirrored in
code (`src/lib/constants.ts`); **do not invent, round, or change any value here or in code
without updating both and citing the source.** Figures reflect sources current as of mid‑2026;
revisit annually.

## Formula

```
kg CO₂e per year  =  TB × R × ( E_op × CI + Emb )
```

Storage CO₂ is a **rate** (per TB *per year of retention*); multiply by retention years for a
cumulative total. The boundary is **operational energy + cooling (PUE) + amortized
manufacturing**. It **excludes data transfer and access**, which are a separate, access-driven
term (and can rival storage) — do not fold them into this number.

## Default constants and defensible ranges

| Symbol | Meaning | Default | Range | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `E_op` | Operational energy, all‑in (includes PUE) | **8 kWh/TB/yr** | 5–15 | LBNL/Shehabi 2024 device power (~6.4 W/disk HDD, ~capacity‑independent) ⇒ ~0.4–1.2 W/TB at the storage‑system level × PUE 1.1–1.6 (Uptime: avg ~1.5, hyperscale ~1.1) |
| `CI` | Grid carbon intensity | **0.40 kg/kWh** | 0.05–0.70 | US grid average ~0.38–0.40 (EPA eGRID / OWID). Use **0.55** to reflect where data centers actually sit (Guidi et al. 2024); near 0 for a renewable‑matched provider |
| `Emb` | Amortized embodied (manufacturing) carbon | **0.35 kg CO₂e/TB/yr** | 0.2–0.5 | Modern enterprise HDD ~1.2–2.5 kg CO₂e/TB one‑time (Seagate, Pure) ÷ ~4–5 yr service life |
| `R` | Replication / durability multiplier | **1** (physical TB) | 1–3 | Single‑region erasure coding ~1.35×; triple / cross‑region replication ~3× |

## Headline result

For **modern HDD‑based cloud storage, per physical TB, operational + amortized embodied:**

> **≈ 5 kg CO₂e per TB per year — defensible band 3–8 kg.**

Worked check: US‑average grid → `8 × 0.40 + 0.35 ≈ 3.6 kg`; data‑center‑weighted grid →
`8 × 0.55 + 0.35 ≈ 4.7 kg`. Pushing both ends of every range yields the 3–8 band.

The HDD figure is robust because **operational energy dominates and embodied is a small
(~5–10%) add‑on**, so including embodied (which makes the number complete) barely moves it.

## The two levers that move the number

1. **Physical vs. logical TB (`R`).** The single most important design choice. If the user
   enters storage they *perceive* using (logical — what shows in their cloud account), the
   provider keeps more on disk for durability. For a consumer‑facing tool, either default `R`
   to ~2 or expose a toggle (1× raw disk / 1.35× erasure‑coded / 3× triple‑replicated). With a
   typical durability factor the logical‑TB headline is roughly **8–15 kg CO₂e/TB/yr**.
2. **Grid (`CI`).** A legitimate ~0.05–0.70 slider, not a fixed constant. Reasonable presets:
   "US average" (0.40), "where data centers tend to be" (0.55), "renewable‑matched provider"
   (≈0.05).

## SSD / hot‑tier caveat — do NOT use a single SSD number

For SSD‑backed storage, embodied carbon dominates **and published LCAs disagree by ~50×**:
Seagate's data implies ≈33 kg CO₂e/TB/yr embodied (30 TB SSD), while Pure Storage's implies
≈0.6 kg/TB/yr (modern high‑density SSD). Both are ISO‑14040‑based; they are vendors with
opposite incentives. There is no defensible single SSD value today.

**Design rule:** default the calculator to HDD / general cloud (where the vast majority of bulk
stored data lives). If you offer an SSD/hot‑tier option, present it as a clearly‑labeled wide
range or a "~2–6× the HDD figure" multiplier — never a point estimate.

---

## Calculator design rules

- Always display a **central value and a range**, never a single false‑precise figure.
- Expose at most ~3 inputs: replication (`R`), grid (`CI`), and optionally HDD/SSD. Use the
  defaults above for everything else.
- Show the boundary in a footnote: *operational energy + cooling + amortized manufacturing,
  per year of retention; excludes data transfer and access.*
- State the unit explicitly in the UI (physical vs. logical TB) so the result is interpretable.

---

## Rules for Claude (and other contributors)

- These constants are **authoritative**. Do not substitute values from training data, blog
  posts, or "common estimates."
- The numbers live in code at `src/lib/constants.ts`; a unit test asserts the formula and a
  sample output. If you change a constant, update **this doc, the source citation, the code,
  and the test** together.
- If asked for a figure this doc doesn't cover, say so and flag it rather than guessing.

## Behavior / transmission (rougher — order-of-magnitude only)

These cover *sending/use*, not storage, and are far less settled. Always show as a range.

| Lever | Coefficient | Range | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email sent | per message | 0.3–4 g CO₂e | Berners-Lee 2010: spam 0.3 g / standard 4 g / large attachment ~50 g; 2020 ed. revised to 0.03–26 g. |
| Video call | per camera-on hour | 55–1,000 g CO₂e/hr | Obringer et al. 2021 (150–1,000 g/hr, "rough"); Carbon Trust 2021 far lower (low bound). |
| Camera off | saving | ~96% of the call | Obringer et al. 2021. |

kg/yr avoided = per-week count × 52 × people × (g per unit) ÷ 1000.
Network energy is largely fixed, not proportional to bitrate — treat as directional.
